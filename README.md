# Testing pg_vector

Follow these steps:

* Start Docker and run docker compose (```docker compose up -d```)
* Create the database and table (```postgre.sql```)
* Insert the data (```insert.py```)
  * This will insert a list of random texts generated by ChatGPT, together with their embedding generated by the OpenAI API
* Query the data (```query.py```)
  * This will ask you for a prompt, generate the embedding for the question and then query the database using pg_vector search (L2 distance) and return the two closest texts
